Experimental example of a json read/write api in golang, backed by mongodb.

This is an example or how to write mediocre go code with no tests - don't try to use this for anything serious.

Installation:

You will need a mongodb database called "testdb", then:

go get git.svc.ft.com/scm/cp/jsonapi-go.git/jsonapi

Running:

jsonapi

You now have an endpoint listening on 0.0.0.0:8082
